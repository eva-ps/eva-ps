## Hello!! 👋 

My name is Evangelia Psochiou. I have an academic background in materials science and engineering.

After graduating from Coding Factory, a full-stack application program offered by the Athens University of Economics and Business, I made a career change.

Recently, I started my journey in the programming field as a junior software engineer.
